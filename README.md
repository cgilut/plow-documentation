# What are commodities? 
Commodities as raw materials or basic goods that are the same no matter where you get them. Things like gold, oil, wheat, and coffee are all commodities. They're things that are grown, mined, or produced and traded on a large scale. They are interchangeable – it doesn’t matter which farm or well they came from, they have no brands and are all pretty similar. They play a big role in the global economy because they're essential for making all sorts of products, so their prices can have a big impact on businesses and consumers worldwide.

# Types and categories of commodities.

Commodities can be broken down into two main groups: “**<font color="red">soft</font>**” and “**hard**” commodities. 
### Soft Commodities
These are the ones that come from the ground or are grown on farms. Think of crops like wheat, rubber, soybeans, coffee, sugar, cocoa, and cotton.
### Hard Commodities
On the flip side, we have "hard" commodities, which are typically dug up or extracted from the earth. This group includes raw materials like gold, silver, copper, aluminum, crude oil, and natural gas.

Furthermore, Commodities are commonly sorted into four main groups: **energy, metals, livestock and meat, and agricultural products.**

### Energy
Energy commodities are things like crude oil, natural gas, and coal, which are important for many aspects of our daily lives. Energy prices affect how much we pay for things like food, clothes, electronics, and gas for our cars. 

Global energy usage by developing nations is expected to go up by almost 30% over the next two decades, while growth in developed countries will be slower.
### Metals
There are precious metals like gold and silver that people often invest in when the stock market is uncertain. They're seen as safe investments. But there's also a growing demand for other metals, especially in the tech industry. Some of these metals are used in things like smartphones, electric cars, and renewable energy batteries. 

However, getting these metals can cause problems, like environmental damage and unfair treatment of local communities in places where they're mined.
### Livestock and Meat
Livestock is the term for the domesticated animals raised on farms for food, labor, and other things. Livestock are mainly valued for their meat, which includes beef, pork, lamb, and poultry like chicken and turkey. The meat industry is global, with trade agreements and international relations affecting how meat is traded. 

While some people are choosing alternative protein sources like plant-based and lab-grown meats, the demand for meat is expected to increase by about 14% by 2030 because more people around the world are getting richer and the population is growing. 

Some places, like Asia and the Middle East, don't produce enough meat locally, so they import a lot. However, there are concerns about the environmental impact of raising livestock, so there's a growing interest in more sustainable farming methods.
### Agricultural products
Agricultural commodities are the products that come from farming and encompass a diverse range including corn, wheat, rice, cotton, and rubber. These commodities are essential for food production and find application across various industries, from textiles to biofuels and pharmaceuticals.

In recent decades, the agricultural sector has undergone significant transformations. Shifting weather patterns are impacting crop yields and changing traditional farming practices. Consumer preferences are turning towards organic and locally sourced foods, prompting shifts in farming methods and marketing strategies.

Advancements in genetic engineering have led to the development of crops engineered to resist pests, diseases, and adverse weather conditions. However, some people are concerned regarding the safety of genetically modified organisms (GMOs).

As farms become more important in the global market, competition is getting tougher and consumer demands are evolving. Farmers are increasingly adopting environmentally conscious practices to match growing concerns about sustainability. This involves using techniques that promote biodiversity and minimize ecological impact.

Farmers are using cutting-edge technologies such as GPS systems, drones, automated machinery, and big data analytics to navigate these changes. These innovations optimize production efficiency and crop management, allowing farmers to maximize yields despite the constraints imposed by the constant urban expansion and diminishing arable land.

### Why do commodity prices change?
Various factors influence commodity prices. These factors include changes in costs related to carrying, storing, insuring, and financing commodities. Currency fluctuations, geopolitical and economic stability, and global economic trends also play significant roles. Government policies, inflation, and interest rates affect commodity prices, as do market speculation and storage/transportation costs. Additionally, supply and demand dynamics, technological advances, and weather/environmental events are key factors driving commodity price movements. These influences can lead to price volatility and impact both investors and consumers alike, making the commodity market complex and interconnected with global events and economic conditions.

### Instruments for financing commodities
Commodity futures and options are financial instruments used for financing commodities. They offer ways for market participants to manage risk and secure commodity prices. 
Futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell a specific quantity of a commodity at a predetermined price on a future date. They're commonly used by producers, consumers, and investors to hedge against price fluctuations, and they provide a way to lock in prices for future delivery.
Options contracts give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) a commodity at a specified price within a predetermined period. Options give the flexibility to either buy or sell commodities at predetermined prices. This way sellers can protect themselves from potential losses, and buyers from potential price increases. 

### What are Incoterms?
Incoterms are a set of standardized international trade terms that define the responsibilities of buyers and sellers in the transportation and delivery of goods. These terms are published by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), and the latest version is **Incoterms® 2020**. 
- **Category E (EXW)**

The **EXW** Incoterm stands for "Ex Works". With EXW, the seller's obligation is to have the goods ready for pickup by the buyer, and the buyer takes care of everything else from there. None of the transportation costs are paid by the seller.
- **Category F (FCA, FAS and FOB)**

**Category F** of Incoterms includes three terms: **FCA** (Free Carrier), **FAS** (Free Alongside Ship), and **FOB** (Free On Board). These terms primarily define the point at which the seller fulfills their obligation and transfers risk to the buyer in maritime or multimodal transportation scenarios.

With **FCA**, the seller delivers the goods, cleared for export, to the carrier nominated by the buyer at a named place. The risk passes from the seller to the buyer when the goods are handed over to the carrier at the agreed-upon location.

**FAS** requires the seller to deliver the goods alongside a named vessel at the port of shipment. The seller's responsibility ends once the goods are placed alongside the ship.

**FOB** is similar to FAS, but it goes a step further. With FOB, the risk transfers from the seller to the buyer once the goods pass over the ship's rail at the port of shipment.

In summary, all three Incoterms in **Category F** involve the seller being responsible for delivering the goods to a specific point at or alongside a vessel. Most of the transportation costs are paid for by the buyer.
- **Category C (CFR, CIF, CPT, and CIP)**

**Category C** of Incoterms includes four terms: **CFR** (Cost and Freight), **CIF** (Cost, Insurance, and Freight), **CPT** (Carriage Paid To), and **CIP** (Carriage and Insurance Paid To). These terms govern the seller's obligations and the transfer of risk in the transportation of goods, primarily in maritime or multimodal transportation scenarios.

With **CFR**, the seller is responsible for delivering the goods onto the vessel at the port of shipment. They also bear the costs and risks of transportation to the named destination port. However, the buyer assumes responsibility for unloading the goods and bears the risk of loss or damage once the goods are loaded onto the vessel.

**CIF** is similar to CFR, but with the additional requirement that the seller must obtain marine insurance against the buyer's risk of loss or damage to the goods during transit.

Under **CPT**, the seller is responsible for delivering the goods to the carrier or another person nominated by the seller at a named place. The seller pays the freight charges for carriage to the named destination, but risk transfers from the seller to the buyer once the goods are delivered to the carrier.

**CIP** is similar to CPT but includes the additional requirement that the seller must obtain insurance against the buyer's risk of loss or damage to the goods during transit.

In summary, **Category C** Incoterms involve the seller being responsible for delivering the goods to a specific place and paying for transportation to that place. Most of the transportation costs are paid for by the seller.
- **Category D (DPU, DAP and DDP)**

**Category D** of Incoterms includes three terms: DAP (Delivered at Place), DPU (Delivered at Place Unloaded), and DDP (Delivered Duty Paid). These terms outline the seller's obligations and the transfer of risk in the transportation of goods, focusing on delivery to a named destination.

With **DAP**, the seller is responsible for delivering the goods, cleared for import, to the buyer at the named destination place. The seller bears all risks and costs until the goods are ready for unloading at the agreed-upon destination. However, the buyer is responsible for unloading the goods and clearing them through customs.

**DPU** is similar to DAP, but with the additional responsibility for the seller to unload the goods at the named destination.

**DDP** places the maximum responsibility on the seller. The seller is responsible for delivering the goods, cleared for import, to the buyer at the named destination. The seller bears all risks and costs, including duties, taxes, and customs clearance, until the goods are delivered to the buyer's premises or another named place.

In summary, **Category D** Incoterms involve the seller being responsible for delivering the goods to a specific place, clearing for import, and bearing all risks and costs until delivery. All of the transportation costs are paid by the seller.

### Container Transportation

In the pre-industrial era, transporting goods across continents and oceans was very costly, limiting long-distance trade to only the most profitable commodities like gold, silver, spices, and coffee. However, advancements in transport technologies, including the introduction of large bulk carriers and massive harbor facilities, dramatically reduced shipping costs for bulk goods.

Over a century from the 1870s onwards, these costs decreased by approximately 90%. As a result, today, commodities of various values are transported worldwide, making global trade accessible to a wide range of goods. Even seemingly low-value items like metal scrap, recyclable materials, and refuse destined for landfills are economically viable to transport across oceans due to the significantly reduced costs.

Today one of the pillars of international trade is the **container shipping**. It is a method of transporting goods using standardized containers that can be easily loaded, unloaded, and transferred between different modes of transportation, such as ships, trucks, and trains. The standardization of container sizes has greatly streamlined the logistics of global trade, making it more efficient and cost-effective.

A shipping container is a standardized steel box. **20- and 40-foot containers** are the most common standard container sizes used in container shipping. A 20-foot container is the standard size container, measuring approximately 20 feet in length, 8 feet in width, and 8.5 feet in height. It's commonly referred to as a **Twenty-Foot Equivalent Unit (TEU)**. A 40-foot container is twice the length of a 20-foot container. It is referred to as a **Forty-Foot Equivalent Unit (FEU)**.
There are also variations of these standard sizes, such as **40- and 45-foot high-cube containers**, which have taller dimensions to accommodate larger or bulkier cargo.

Common shipping methods in container shipping are **FCL** (Full Container Load) and **LCL** (Less than Container Load).  

In **FCL** shipping, a single container is exclusively used to transport goods belonging to one shipper. The container is filled to its capacity with cargo from one source and delivered to one destination. 

In **LCL** shipping, multiple shipments from different shippers are consolidated into a single container. This allows smaller shipments to be cost-effectively transported by sharing container space with other shipments. The costs in LCL shipping depend either on cubic meters or metric tons of the cargo.

### Trade Financing

Trade finance is all about making international trade smoother and safer by involving a third party to handle payment and supply risks. It helps exporters get paid and importers fulfill orders without worrying about risks like non-payment, currency changes, or political instability.

One such tool is the Letter of credit. A **letter of credit (LC)** is a document issued by a bank on behalf of a buyer (importer) to guarantee payment to a seller (exporter) once certain conditions are met. It serves as a secure method of payment in international trade, providing assurance to both the buyer and seller. The bank assures the seller that they will receive payment once they fulfill the terms of the agreement, such as providing proof of shipment. Overall, a letter of credit helps facilitate smooth and secure transactions in global trade.

### Rubber

Rubber has a long history that stretches back centuries. Natural rubber originates from the Amazon Rainforest region.  The indigenous peoples of South America, particularly those in the Amazon basin, were the first to discover the latex sap produced by certain trees, such as Hevea brasiliensis, commonly known as the rubber tree. They utilized this latex for various purposes, including waterproofing, making shoes, and creating balls for sports. 

In the 19th century, European explorers established rubber plantations in Southeast Asia to meet the growing demand. Today the three leading producers of natural rubber, Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia, together account for over 70% of all natural rubber production. 

However, only half of the world’s produced rubber is natural. The rest is synthetic, derived from petroleum. The development of synthetic rubber was driven by the need to find alternatives to natural rubber, particularly during times of rubber shortages, such as during World War 2.

One of the most significant breakthroughs came with the invention of neoprene by DuPont chemist Wallace Carothers in the 1930s. Neoprene, a type of synthetic rubber, offers excellent resistance to oil, heat, and weathering, making it ideal for use in automotive, aerospace, and industrial applications.

Since then, numerous types of synthetic rubber have been developed to meet specific needs and challenges. These include styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), polybutadiene rubber (PBR), and styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS), among others. Each type of synthetic rubber has its unique properties, such as elasticity, durability, and resistance to chemicals and temperature extremes.

Synthetic rubber has become indispensable in modern manufacturing, finding its way into countless products, from tires and conveyor belts to seals, gaskets, and footwear. Its versatility, consistency, and ability to be tailored to specific requirements have made it a preferred choice for many industries.

Moreover, synthetic rubber offers advantages over natural rubber in terms of availability, consistency, and performance characteristics. It can be produced on a larger scale and with greater control over its properties, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.
