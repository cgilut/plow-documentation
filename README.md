# What are commodities? 
Commodities as raw materials or basic goods that are the same no matter where you get them. Things like gold, oil, wheat, and coffee are all commodities. They're things that are grown, mined, or produced and traded on a large scale. They are interchangeable – it doesn’t matter which farm or well they came from, they have no brands and are all pretty similar. They play a big role in the global economy because they're essential for making all sorts of products, so their prices can have a big impact on businesses and consumers worldwide.

# Types and categories of commodities.

Commodities can be broken down into two main groups: “**<font color="red">soft</font>**” and “**hard**” commodities. 
### Soft Commodities
These are the ones that come from the ground or are grown on farms. Think of crops like wheat, rubber, soybeans, coffee, sugar, cocoa, and cotton.
### Hard Commodities
On the flip side, we have "hard" commodities, which are typically dug up or extracted from the earth. This group includes raw materials like gold, silver, copper, aluminum, crude oil, and natural gas.

Furthermore, Commodities are commonly sorted into four main groups: **energy, metals, livestock and meat, and agricultural products.**

### Energy
Energy commodities are things like crude oil, natural gas, and coal, which are important for many aspects of our daily lives. Energy prices affect how much we pay for things like food, clothes, electronics, and gas for our cars. 

Global energy usage by developing nations is expected to go up by almost 30% over the next two decades, while growth in developed countries will be slower.
### Metals
There are precious metals like gold and silver that people often invest in when the stock market is uncertain. They're seen as safe investments. But there's also a growing demand for other metals, especially in the tech industry. Some of these metals are used in things like smartphones, electric cars, and renewable energy batteries. 

However, getting these metals can cause problems, like environmental damage and unfair treatment of local communities in places where they're mined.
### Livestock and Meat
Livestock is the term for the domesticated animals raised on farms for food, labor, and other things. Livestock are mainly valued for their meat, which includes beef, pork, lamb, and poultry like chicken and turkey. The meat industry is global, with trade agreements and international relations affecting how meat is traded. 

While some people are choosing alternative protein sources like plant-based and lab-grown meats, the demand for meat is expected to increase by about 14% by 2030 because more people around the world are getting richer and the population is growing. 

Some places, like Asia and the Middle East, don't produce enough meat locally, so they import a lot. However, there are concerns about the environmental impact of raising livestock, so there's a growing interest in more sustainable farming methods.
### Agricultural products
Agricultural commodities are the products that come from farming and encompass a diverse range including corn, wheat, rice, cotton, and rubber. These commodities are essential for food production and find application across various industries, from textiles to biofuels and pharmaceuticals.

In recent decades, the agricultural sector has undergone significant transformations. Shifting weather patterns are impacting crop yields and changing traditional farming practices. Consumer preferences are turning towards organic and locally sourced foods, prompting shifts in farming methods and marketing strategies.

Advancements in genetic engineering have led to the development of crops engineered to resist pests, diseases, and adverse weather conditions. However, some people are concerned regarding the safety of genetically modified organisms (GMOs).

As farms become more important in the global market, competition is getting tougher and consumer demands are evolving. Farmers are increasingly adopting environmentally conscious practices to match growing concerns about sustainability. This involves using techniques that promote biodiversity and minimize ecological impact.

Farmers are using cutting-edge technologies such as GPS systems, drones, automated machinery, and big data analytics to navigate these changes. These innovations optimize production efficiency and crop management, allowing farmers to maximize yields despite the constraints imposed by the constant urban expansion and diminishing arable land.

# Why do commodity prices change?
Various factors influence commodity prices. These factors include changes in costs related to carrying, storing, insuring, and financing commodities. Currency fluctuations, geopolitical and economic stability, and global economic trends also play significant roles. Government policies, inflation, and interest rates affect commodity prices, as do market speculation and storage/transportation costs. Additionally, supply and demand dynamics, technological advances, and weather/environmental events are key factors driving commodity price movements. These influences can lead to price volatility and impact both investors and consumers alike, making the commodity market complex and interconnected with global events and economic conditions.

# Instruments for financing commodities
Commodity futures and options are financial instruments used for financing commodities. They offer ways for market participants to manage risk and secure commodity prices. 
Futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell a specific quantity of a commodity at a predetermined price on a future date. They're commonly used by producers, consumers, and investors to hedge against price fluctuations, and they provide a way to lock in prices for future delivery.
Options contracts give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) a commodity at a specified price within a predetermined period. Options give the flexibility to either buy or sell commodities at predetermined prices. This way sellers can protect themselves from potential losses, and buyers from potential price increases. 

# What are Incoterms?
Incoterms are a set of standardized international trade terms that define the responsibilities of buyers and sellers in the transportation and delivery of goods. These terms are published by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), and the latest version is **Incoterms® 2020**. 
- **Category E (EXW)**

The **EXW** Incoterm stands for "Ex Works". With EXW, the seller's obligation is to have the goods ready for pickup by the buyer, and the buyer takes care of everything else from there. None of the transportation costs are paid by the seller.
- **Category F (FCA, FAS and FOB)**

**Category F** of Incoterms includes three terms: **FCA** (Free Carrier), **FAS** (Free Alongside Ship), and **FOB** (Free On Board). These terms primarily define the point at which the seller fulfills their obligation and transfers risk to the buyer in maritime or multimodal transportation scenarios.

With **FCA**, the seller delivers the goods, cleared for export, to the carrier nominated by the buyer at a named place. The risk passes from the seller to the buyer when the goods are handed over to the carrier at the agreed-upon location.

**FAS** requires the seller to deliver the goods alongside a named vessel at the port of shipment. The seller's responsibility ends once the goods are placed alongside the ship.

**FOB** is similar to FAS, but it goes a step further. With FOB, the risk transfers from the seller to the buyer once the goods pass over the ship's rail at the port of shipment.

In summary, all three Incoterms in **Category F** involve the seller being responsible for delivering the goods to a specific point at or alongside a vessel. Most of the transportation costs are paid for by the buyer.
- **Category C (CFR, CIF, CPT, and CIP)**

**Category C** of Incoterms includes four terms: **CFR** (Cost and Freight), **CIF** (Cost, Insurance, and Freight), **CPT** (Carriage Paid To), and **CIP** (Carriage and Insurance Paid To). These terms govern the seller's obligations and the transfer of risk in the transportation of goods, primarily in maritime or multimodal transportation scenarios.

With **CFR**, the seller is responsible for delivering the goods onto the vessel at the port of shipment. They also bear the costs and risks of transportation to the named destination port. However, the buyer assumes responsibility for unloading the goods and bears the risk of loss or damage once the goods are loaded onto the vessel.

**CIF** is similar to CFR, but with the additional requirement that the seller must obtain marine insurance against the buyer's risk of loss or damage to the goods during transit.

Under **CPT**, the seller is responsible for delivering the goods to the carrier or another person nominated by the seller at a named place. The seller pays the freight charges for carriage to the named destination, but risk transfers from the seller to the buyer once the goods are delivered to the carrier.

**CIP** is similar to CPT but includes the additional requirement that the seller must obtain insurance against the buyer's risk of loss or damage to the goods during transit.

In summary, **Category C** Incoterms involve the seller being responsible for delivering the goods to a specific place and paying for transportation to that place. Most of the transportation costs are paid for by the seller.
- **Category D (DPU, DAP and DDP)**

**Category D** of Incoterms includes three terms: DAP (Delivered at Place), DPU (Delivered at Place Unloaded), and DDP (Delivered Duty Paid). These terms outline the seller's obligations and the transfer of risk in the transportation of goods, focusing on delivery to a named destination.

With **DAP**, the seller is responsible for delivering the goods, cleared for import, to the buyer at the named destination place. The seller bears all risks and costs until the goods are ready for unloading at the agreed-upon destination. However, the buyer is responsible for unloading the goods and clearing them through customs.

**DPU** is similar to DAP, but with the additional responsibility for the seller to unload the goods at the named destination.

**DDP** places the maximum responsibility on the seller. The seller is responsible for delivering the goods, cleared for import, to the buyer at the named destination. The seller bears all risks and costs, including duties, taxes, and customs clearance, until the goods are delivered to the buyer's premises or another named place.

In summary, **Category D** Incoterms involve the seller being responsible for delivering the goods to a specific place, clearing for import, and bearing all risks and costs until delivery. All of the transportation costs are paid by the seller.


| Category | Risks & Responsibilities |
| -------- | ------- |
| E | buyer |
| F | mostly buyer |
| C | mostly seller |
| D | seller |

# Container Transportation

In the pre-industrial era, transporting goods across continents and oceans was very costly, limiting long-distance trade to only the most profitable commodities like gold, silver, spices, and coffee. However, advancements in transport technologies, including the introduction of large bulk carriers and massive harbor facilities, dramatically reduced shipping costs for bulk goods.

Over a century from the 1870s onwards, these costs decreased by approximately 90%. As a result, today, commodities of various values are transported worldwide, making global trade accessible to a wide range of goods. Even seemingly low-value items like metal scrap, recyclable materials, and refuse destined for landfills are economically viable to transport across oceans due to the significantly reduced costs.

Today one of the pillars of international trade is the **container shipping**. It is a method of transporting goods using standardized containers that can be easily loaded, unloaded, and transferred between different modes of transportation, such as ships, trucks, and trains. The standardization of container sizes has greatly streamlined the logistics of global trade, making it more efficient and cost-effective.

A shipping container is a standardized steel box. **20- and 40-foot containers** are the most common standard container sizes used in container shipping. A 20-foot container is the standard size container, measuring approximately 20 feet in length, 8 feet in width, and 8.5 feet in height. It's commonly referred to as a **Twenty-Foot Equivalent Unit (TEU)**. A 40-foot container is twice the length of a 20-foot container. It is referred to as a **Forty-Foot Equivalent Unit (FEU)**.
There are also variations of these standard sizes, such as **40- and 45-foot high-cube containers**, which have taller dimensions to accommodate larger or bulkier cargo.

Common shipping methods in container shipping are **FCL** (Full Container Load) and **LCL** (Less than Container Load).  

In **FCL** shipping, a single container is exclusively used to transport goods belonging to one shipper. The container is filled to its capacity with cargo from one source and delivered to one destination. 

In **LCL** shipping, multiple shipments from different shippers are consolidated into a single container. This allows smaller shipments to be cost-effectively transported by sharing container space with other shipments. The costs in LCL shipping depend either on cubic meters or metric tons of the cargo.

# Contracts

Term contracts and spot contracts are both types of agreements commonly used in business, particularly in the context of purchasing goods or services.

### Spot contract

A spot contract is an agreement where goods or services are bought or sold for immediate delivery and payment. It's a straightforward transaction where the price is determined by the current market conditions, often referred to as the spot price.

### Term contract

A term contract, on the other hand, is a longer-term agreement between a buyer and a seller for the purchase or sale of goods or services over a specified period. The terms of the contract, including price, quantity, and delivery schedule, are negotiated and agreed upon in advance. Unlike spot contracts, which are for immediate transactions, term contracts provide stability and predictability for both parties over the agreed-upon period.

# Letter of Credit

A Letter of Credit is a financial document issued by a bank on behalf of a buyer to guarantee payment to a seller upon the fulfillment of specified conditions. It serves as a promise of payment, ensuring that the seller will receive the agreed-upon funds once they meet the terms outlined in the LC. Letters of Credit (LC) are vital instruments in international trade, facilitating transactions between buyers and sellers across borders. 

In the realm of global commerce, where parties may be located thousands of miles apart, trust and assurance in payment are paramount. LCs play a pivotal role in mitigating the inherent risks associated with cross-border transactions. They provide a secure mechanism for both buyers and sellers, instilling confidence and enabling trade to flourish even amidst geographical and cultural differences.

At its core, the purpose of a Letter of Credit is twofold: to safeguard the interests of both parties involved in a transaction and to facilitate smooth and efficient trade operations. For the buyer, an LC offers assurance that payment will only be made once the seller fulfills their contractual obligations, such as delivering the goods or providing the services as agreed. Meanwhile, the seller gains the confidence of knowing that they will receive payment as per the terms stipulated in the LC, thus reducing the risk of non-payment or default.

In essence, Letters of Credit serve as the backbone of international trade, fostering trust, reliability, and mutual benefit among global business partners.

Letters of Credit come in various forms, each tailored to specific trade requirements and circumstances:

### Commercial Letters of Credit

A commercial letter of credit is a financial instrument issued by a bank on behalf of a buyer to facilitate trade with a seller. It guarantees payment to the seller upon the presentation of compliant documents, such as bill of lading, CMR, Railway Bill, etc., confirming the shipment of goods as per the terms of the underlying contract.

Commercial LCs are primarily used in trade transactions to ensure payment for the purchase of goods or services. They provide assurance of payment to the seller, subject to the fulfillment of the specified conditions and the presentation of compliant documents. Commercial LCs are not intended to provide financing to the buyer but rather to facilitate the smooth flow of trade by minimizing the risk of non-payment for the seller.

### Standby Letters of Credit (SBLC)

A standby letter of credit is a secondary payment mechanism issued by a bank on behalf of a buyer to provide assurance of payment to a seller in the event of non-performance or default by the buyer. SBLCs are often used as a form of financial guarantee or security for various contractual obligations. They serve as a backup payment mechanism, triggered only if the buyer fails to fulfill their payment obligations or meet other specified conditions.

### Divisible Letter of Credit

A Divisible Letter of Credit (LC) is a type of LC that allows the seller to draw partial amounts under the LC instead of requiring the entire amount to be drawn at once. This provides flexibility in transactions where multiple shipments or deliveries are involved. In a divisible LC arrangement, the seller can present separate sets of documents for each partial shipment or delivery, each corresponding to a portion of the total LC amount.

### Revocable/Irrevocable Letter of Credit

A Revocable Letter of Credit (LC) is a type of LC that can be modified or canceled by the issuing bank without prior notice to the seller or buyer. In a revocable LC arrangement, the terms and conditions of the LC, including the amount, expiry date, and other terms, can be changed or revoked at any time by the issuing bank. This lack of security and certainty makes revocable LCs less favorable for sellers, as they carry a higher risk of non-payment or alterations to the terms of the LC without their consent.

On the other hand, an Irrevocable Letter of Credit is a type of LC that cannot be altered or canceled without the consent of all parties involved, including the seller and buyer. Once an irrevocable LC is issued, the terms and conditions specified in the LC are binding and cannot be changed unilaterally by the issuing bank. Irrevocable LCs are widely used in international trade transactions to provide a secure and reliable payment mechanism for sellers and buyers alike.

### Payable at Sight Letter of Credit

A Payable at Sight Letter of Credit (LC) is a type of LC where payment is made immediately upon presentation of compliant documents by the seller, without any delay or waiting period. In other words, once the seller fulfills the terms and conditions specified in the LC and presents the required documents to the issuing bank, the bank is obligated to honor the LC and make payment to the seller without delay.

### Confirmed/Unconfirmed Letter of Credit

An Unconfirmed Letter of Credit (LC) is a type of LC where the seller relies solely on the creditworthiness of the issuing bank to guarantee payment. In an unconfirmed LC arrangement, the seller receives the LC directly from the buyer's bank (the issuing bank) and does not involve any additional confirmation from another bank. 

In contrast, a Confirmed Letter of Credit provides an additional level of assurance to the seller by involving a second bank (the confirming bank) to confirm the LC. In a confirmed LC arrangement, the confirming bank adds its guarantee to that of the issuing bank, providing a double layer of security for the seller. If the issuing bank defaults or fails to honor the LC, the confirming bank is obligated to fulfill the payment obligation, thereby mitigating the risk for the seller. 

### Clean Letter of Credit

A Clean Letter of Credit (LC) is a type of LC that does not require the presentation of specific shipping documents or invoices to trigger payment. Instead, payment is based solely on the buyer's creditworthiness. In a clean LC arrangement, the seller does not need to provide evidence of shipment or delivery of goods or services to receive payment.

Clean LCs are often used in situations where the buyer has a well-established relationship with the issuing bank and is deemed creditworthy. The buyer's creditworthiness serves as the primary basis for the issuance of the LC, and the seller can rely on the bank's commitment to honor the LC without the need for additional documentation.

For sellers, clean LCs offer a streamlined payment process, as they eliminate the need to prepare and present detailed shipping documents or invoices. This can result in faster payment and reduced administrative burden for sellers, making clean LCs an attractive option for certain types of transactions.

### Transferable Letter of Credit

A Transferable Letter of Credit (LC) is a specialized type of LC that allows the seller to transfer all or part of the credit to one or more secondary beneficiaries, who can then receive payment from the issuing bank. In a transferable LC arrangement, the seller acts as an intermediary between the original buyer and the secondary beneficiaries, facilitating transactions where they are not the ultimate supplier of goods or services.

### Red Clause Letter of Credit

A Red Clause Letter of Credit (LC) is a specialized type of LC that includes a specific clause, often printed in red ink, allowing for partial advance payment to the seller before the shipment of goods. In a Red Clause LC arrangement, the buyer's bank agrees to advance funds to the seller upon the presentation of a written request or draft from the seller, typically accompanied by a written statement detailing the purpose of the advance and the amount requested.

# Parties to Letters of Credit

There are several parties involved in a typical letter of credit transaction, each with specific roles and responsibilities:

### Applicant: 
The applicant is usually the buyer or importer who requests the letter of credit from their bank. They are the party obligated to make payment under the terms of the letter of credit once the conditions specified in the document are met.

### Beneficiary: 
The beneficiary is the seller or exporter who will receive payment under the letter of credit. They are entitled to payment as long as they fulfill the terms and conditions stipulated in the LC, typically by presenting the required documents proving the shipment of the goods as per the agreed-upon terms.

### Issuing Bank: 
The issuing bank is the bank that issues the letter of credit at the request of the applicant. It undertakes to honor the beneficiary's compliant presentation of documents within the terms of the LC. The issuing bank's obligation is independent of the underlying sales contract between the buyer and the seller.

### Advising Bank:
The advising bank, also known as the notifying bank, is the bank in the beneficiary's country that receives the letter of credit from the issuing bank and advises it to the beneficiary. The advising bank's role is primarily to authenticate the letter of credit and forward it to the beneficiary.

### Nominated Bank: 
The Nominated bank, also known as the negotiating bank, is the bank that examines the documents presented by the beneficiary and decides whether to negotiate them (i.e., pay or accept them). It is the bank with which the credit is available or any bank in the case of a credit available with any bank.

### Confirming Bank: 
In some cases, the beneficiary may request that the LC be confirmed by a bank in their own country or a more reputable international bank. A confirming bank is a bank other than the issuing bank that adds its confirmation to a credit upon the issuing bank’s authorization or request. If the issuing bank fails to honor, the confirming bank must pay to the beneficiary.

### Reimbursing  Bank:
The Reimbursing bank, also known as the paying bank, is the bank designated in the letter of credit as the bank responsible for making payments to the beneficiary upon presentation of compliant documents. 

While these parties are often banks, it's important to note that the functions associated with each party can sometimes be performed by different entities, not necessarily physical banks.

# Letter of Credit Practices

**The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC)** plays a central role in shaping the rules and practices governing Letters of Credit (LCs) through its publication of the **Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (UCP)** and the **International Standby Practices (ISP) for Demand Guarantees**.

The **ICC** is a global business organization that promotes international trade and investment. Founded in 1919, it serves as a forum for businesses and governments to collaborate on matters related to international commerce, including trade finance, arbitration, and commercial law.

### UCP

The **UCP** is a set of internationally recognized rules and guidelines for the use of LCs in trade finance. First published by the ICC in 1933, the UCP has undergone several revisions to reflect changes in international trade practices and regulations.

The UCP provides a standardized framework for LC transactions, ensuring clarity, consistency, and predictability for parties involved in international trade. By establishing uniform rules and procedures, the UCP helps mitigate the risk of disputes and discrepancies, thereby enhancing the efficiency and reliability of LC transactions. It outlines the roles and responsibilities of banks, buyers, and sellers in commercial transactions and sets forth uniform rules for the interpretation of documentary credit terms.

**Key Elements of UCP:**

  - Definition of key terms that are prevalent in international trade (e.g. honoring of payments, applicants, banking days, presentation)
  - How international trade documents (Letters of Credit) can be signed and acknowledged by all parties
  - The difference between documents, goods, and services (and which parties deal with these)
  - Which parts of a Letter of Credit are negotiable and non-negotiable
  - How credit works, and how payment is made
  - How banks can communicate the confirmation of goods (teletransmission)
  - Transportation of the goods, modes of transport, and who bears responsibility
  - How to deal with discrepancies, waivers, and giving notice
  - The provision of original documents or electronic copies
  - Bills of Lading
  - Insurance and covering the cost of goods
  - Loss of shipping documents in transit

The latest version is the UCP 600, which replaced the UCP 500 on the 1st of July 2007.

### ISP

**The International Standby Practices (ISP) for Demand Guarantees**, or simply ISP 98, is a set of rules and guidelines developed by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) specifically for standby letters of credit and demand guarantees. It provides a comprehensive framework for the use and interpretation of standby letters of credit, focusing primarily on the rights and obligations of the parties involved in standby transactions. It was published on the 1st of January 1999.

ISP 98 is tailored specifically for standby letters of credit and demand guarantees, whereas UCP 600 is more broadly applicable to all types of documentary credits, including commercial letters of credit. It provides a detailed legal framework for standby transactions, covering topics such as drafting, issuance, presentation, examination, and payment of standby documents. It emphasizes the autonomy of standby credits and the importance of strict compliance with the terms and conditions specified in the standby.

# Letter of Credit Structure

The realm of letters of credit is vast and constantly evolving. The terms governing letters of credit can vary considerably from one country to another.
As import regulations shift across different nations, banks adjust the language of the letter of credit documents to ensure compliance with these evolving requirements.
On top of that, the specific conditions and requested documentation can differ significantly depending on the industry.
Banks also may require exporters to fulfill a diverse array of document requests, all by the specific terms outlined in the letter of credit.
Lastly, it's not uncommon for banks to alter or even omit certain articles of the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (UCP 600) when issuing letters of credit, reflecting the nuanced nature of international trade finance.

### MT 700

MT 700 is a special swift message type that is used by issuing banks when issuing a letter of credit. It provides a standardized format for communicating the terms and conditions of LCs between banks, ensuring clarity and consistency in international trade finance transactions. When the documentary credit message exceeds the maximum input message length, additional documentary credit information should be transmitted via one or more MT 701s. Up to three MT 701s may be sent in addition to the MT 700.

An issuing bank sends the terms and conditions of the documentary credit with an MT 700 Issue of a Documentary Credit swift message type. MT 700 message is sent by the issuing bank to the advising bank. It is used to indicate the terms and conditions of a documentary credit that has been originated by the Sender (issuing bank).

Here is the structure of a typical MT 700 message:

O : Optional

M : Mandatory

# Rubber

Rubber has a long history that stretches back centuries. Natural rubber originates from the Amazon Rainforest region.  The indigenous peoples of South America, particularly those in the Amazon basin, were the first to discover the latex sap produced by certain trees, such as Hevea brasiliensis, commonly known as the rubber tree. They utilized this latex for various purposes, including waterproofing, making shoes, and creating balls for sports. 

In the 19th century, European explorers established rubber plantations in Southeast Asia to meet the growing demand. Today the three leading producers of natural rubber, Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia, together account for over 70% of all natural rubber production. 

However, only half of the world’s produced rubber is natural. The rest is synthetic, derived from petroleum. The development of synthetic rubber was driven by the need to find alternatives to natural rubber, particularly during times of rubber shortages, such as during World War 2.

One of the most significant breakthroughs came with the invention of neoprene by DuPont chemist Wallace Carothers in the 1930s. Neoprene, a type of synthetic rubber, offers excellent resistance to oil, heat, and weathering, making it ideal for use in automotive, aerospace, and industrial applications.

Since then, numerous types of synthetic rubber have been developed to meet specific needs and challenges. These include styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), polybutadiene rubber (PBR), and styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS), among others. Each type of synthetic rubber has its unique properties, such as elasticity, durability, and resistance to chemicals and temperature extremes.

Synthetic rubber has become indispensable in modern manufacturing, finding its way into countless products, from tires and conveyor belts to seals, gaskets, and footwear. Its versatility, consistency, and ability to be tailored to specific requirements have made it a preferred choice for many industries.

Moreover, synthetic rubber offers advantages over natural rubber in terms of availability, consistency, and performance characteristics. It can be produced on a larger scale and with greater control over its properties, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.

### Styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR):
SBR is commonly used in the production of tires, conveyor belts, shoe soles, and other mechanical goods. It's also utilized in adhesives, coatings, and sealants.
SBR offers good abrasion resistance, resilience, and low-temperature flexibility. It provides excellent adhesion to various substrates and can be easily blended with other polymers to modify properties.

### Butyl rubber (IIR/BIIR/CIIR):
Butyl rubber finds extensive application in tire inner tubes, inner linings for hoses, seals, gaskets, and pharmaceutical stoppers. It's also used in adhesives, agricultural chemicals, and chewing gum.
Butyl rubber exhibits exceptional impermeability to gases, making it ideal for tire inner tubes and other applications requiring gas or liquid barrier properties. It also possesses excellent weathering resistance and damping characteristics.

### Polybutadiene rubber (BR/PBR):
Polybutadiene rubber is primarily employed in the manufacturing of tires, especially for enhancing tread wear resistance and improving wet traction. It's also utilized in conveyor belts, hoses, and various molded and extruded rubber products.
Polybutadiene rubber offers outstanding resilience, abrasion resistance, and tear strength, making it a preferred choice for tire compounds. It provides excellent low-temperature flexibility and high rebound properties.

### Thermoplastic Styrene-Butadiene-Styrene (SBS) elastomer:
SBS elastomers are widely used in asphalt modification for road construction, where they enhance pavement durability and performance. They're also utilized in footwear, roofing materials, adhesives, and polymer-modified bitumen.
SBS elastomers combine the properties of rubber and thermoplastics, offering flexibility, elasticity, and easy processing. They exhibit excellent adhesion to various substrates, good weathering resistance, and compatibility with asphalt binders.

# Sales Order Confirmation

A sales order confirmation serves as a formal acknowledgment of the buyer's purchase and confirms the details of the sales order, including product specifications, quantities, prices, delivery dates, and terms of sale. It is issued by the seller to the buyer after the purchase order has been placed to confirm the agreement and ensure both parties are aligned on the terms of the transaction.

# Buyer’s Instructions to Seller

Buyer's Instructions to Seller (BIS) refer to specific directions or requirements provided by the buyer to the seller regarding the terms, conditions, and procedures related to a transaction. These instructions typically outline the buyer's expectations and preferences regarding various aspects of the transaction, including but not limited to product specifications, delivery terms, payment terms, documentation requirements, compliance and regulations, communication channels, and dispute resolution mechanisms.
